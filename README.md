Connected Sets
==============

Connected Sets (XS) is an Open Source High-Performance JavaScript Database for the development of real-time AJAX and Single-Page Applications using an intuitive API to decrease development time from months to weeks.

Capable of handling millions of records per second, XS is particularly well suited for low-power devices such as tablets and smartphones as well as less-efficient or older JavaScript engines.

XS is a no-compromise database, providing all required primitives for the most demanding applications including filters, ordered sets, aggregates, and joins allowing both normalized and denormalized schemes.

Highest performances are provided thanks to,Just-In-Time code generators delivering performances only available to compiled languages such as C or C++. Unrolling nested loops provide maximum performance while in turn allowing JavaScript JIT compilers to generate code that may be executed optimally in microprocessors' pipelines.

Incremental execution of queries allows to split large datasets into optimal chunks of data rendering data to end-users' interface with low-latency dramatically improving user experience. Updates and removes update Connected Sets in real-time from clients and servers using push technology.

Incremental aggregates allow to deliver real-time OLAP cubes suitable for real-time data analysis and reporting over virtually unlimited size datasets.
