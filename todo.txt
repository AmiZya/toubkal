Current ToDo Lists

Core database engine (sets, filters, ordered sets, aggregates, join):
- All basic functionality is developed
- aggregate(): needs to handle null and undefined dimension values
- join(): fix duplicate record

Basic Table view:
- This is complete, tests need to be automated

Basic controls (checkbox, checkbox groups, drop-down, radio-button groups):
- This is complete, tests need to be automated

Static web site with https support:
- This is complete, tests need to be automated

Optimized static web site with realtime minification:
- This is complete, tests need to be automated

Realtime data exchange between client and server:
- socket_io()
- socket_io_client()
- server()
- clients()

Web Site with contact form:
- form_xxx() pipelets, work is in progress
- email_send()

Database persistance (read-only):
- file(): read on fetch()
- JSON_parse()
- transactions_to_sets()

Database persistance (writes)
- file(): append inputs
- JSON_Stringify()
- sets_to_transactions()

Replication:
- last()
- server(): implement dynamic fetching

Autorizations:
- Authorizations data model
- query_and(): to and with filter query

Further improvements:
- watch():
  - handle directories and glob regexes
  - stat files
  - generate ETag after each actual content change using sha1 digest
- uglify():
  - generate ETag after each acutal content change
  - use stat info of last file
  - store results into file for fast retrieval on no change after server restart
  - extract compiler base pipelet to implement other compilers
  - separate merge and compilation in two independant pipelets
- serve():
  - set response content-length header
  - based on files ETags, set ETag header, check http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/
  - handle HTTP If-None-Match request header
- less_css(): develop using compiler base pipelet
